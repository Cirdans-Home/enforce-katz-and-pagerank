# Proximal Stabilized IPM for Enforcing Centralities

In order to improve the understanding of the code, this folder contains a separate implementation from 
the *enforcers* of the Interior Point Method (IPM) used in the Numerical Experiments.

The method implemented here is the one described in:

whether you use *enforcers* or directly use the IPM method for solving other Linear and convex Quadratic 
Programming refer and cite the result contained here.
