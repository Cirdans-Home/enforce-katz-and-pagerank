# Numerical Examples

This folder contains the MATLAB scripts needed to reproduce the numerical experiments included in the paper.

- `heatmaptest.m` produces the *preliiminary results* in Section 6.4.2 and saves them as a `.mat` file.


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The tests use code that is contained in the `../enforcers` and `../Centrality_Forcing_IPM` folders. 
> Make sure you have added them to the MATLAB path (`addpath(<path>)`).
